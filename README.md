## How to install üèÅ

### Preparing the environment

- Install PostgreSQL: `apt install postgresql`
- Create a `postgres` superuser:
  ```bash
  # sudo -u postgres
  $ psql
  # CREATE ROLE "carbonio-adm" WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER encrypted password 'your-secret-password';
  # CREATE DATABASE "carbonio-tasks-db" owner "carbonio-adm";
  # \q
  ```

### Installation

Install `carbonio-tasks-db` via apt:

```bash
sudo apt install carbonio-tasks-db
```

or via yum:

 ```bash
sudo yum install carbonio-tasks-db
```   

### Configuration

In order to make it work with external databases the `carbonio-tasks-db.hcl` **MUST** be manually
updated by changing the address from `127.0.0.1` to the remote address. To finalize the
configuration:

- Execute `pending-setups` in order to register the service in the `service-discover`
- Bootstrap the database:
  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=your-secret-password carbonio-tasks-db-bootstrap carbonio-adm 127.0.0.1
  ```

If the bootstrap script is executed multiple times it reuses the credentials created the first time
and stored in `service-discover`.

### Reading config values

All the necessary configurations are saved automatically in the `service-discover` configuration
system. They can be retrieved with the following commands:

- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/tasks/service-discover/token" "carbonio-tasks/db-name"`
- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/tasks/service-discover/token" "carbonio-tasks/db-username"`
- `consul kv get -token-file="/etc/carbonio/tasks/service-discover/token" "carbonio-tasks/db-password"`
